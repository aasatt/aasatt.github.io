<h4>Who</h4>

<p><em>Who is this?</em> Let’s get the introductions out of the way: My name is Aaron Satterfield and I am an iOS Developer. I’ve been developing ever since I created my first app way back when I was a sophomore in high school. In a week I’ll be starting my 3rd year in college. </p>

<h4>What</h4>

<p><em>What is this?</em> I am not a writer. This blog will be pretty informal which will be a nice break from scholarly writing I do in school. Chances are I won’t even proof-read before I publish. I know I’m not the first developer to have a blog. I also know that there are endless posts about the latest Swift syntax and Xcode hacks but you’re not gonna see any of that here. I hope to create this as more of a place to post my general observations about iOS development and I know that virtually no one is going to read this anyway.</p>

<h4>Why</h4>

<p><em>Why is this here?</em> Well, this is my first blog post. A blog I hope to keep up on. The website is my public portfolio created to showcase some of my work. I created this site for a couple reasons. This first one is that is that as I made apps that required there own site, it became to expensive. I was previously using this site called <a href="appsites.com" title="App Sites"></a> as a quick fix. It was fine for one app for $10/mo when it was getting some traffic. As I started making more apps and wanting a site just to my ToS or Privacy policy, $20/mo became too much and the site didn’t really offer anything new or exciting. I felt like I outgrew it and I knew I could do something else on my own. </p>

<p><br>So that’s basically it for now. I feel like I could write more but nothing else is really coming to mind. I don’t what this to feel like a chore so when I’m don’t, I’m done.</p>
